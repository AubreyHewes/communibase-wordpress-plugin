Communibase API Support

== Description ==

[Communibase](https://www.communibase.nl) is a paid service for membership administration. See [https://www.communibase.nl](https://www.communibase.nl) for connection details.

This plugin currently only adds a setting screen for setting the API-key and a `WP_Communibase_Connector` delegate that can be used to access the API.
The delegate currently only adds a `Transient_API` caching layer.
